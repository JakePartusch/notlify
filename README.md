  Notlify is a Platform as a Service example that mimics the functionality of Netlify, using AWS Serverless techonologies
</p>

### What is Notlify?

Notlify is an example of building a PaaS with AWS technologies, including S3, CloudFront, and the CDK. Notlify is not intended to be a production hosting service, but rather an example of a platform built entirely with TypeScript, Serverless AWS resources, and with independent deployment isolation. 


### Notlify Features

- **Static Websites** Websites with static assets are all supported. They are continuously deployed on commit to an S3 bucket with a CloudFront distribution.
- **Custom GitHub Action** Notlify applications are simply deployed with a custom GitHub Action

```yaml
- name: Deploy UI
  uses: JakePartusch/notlify-action@main
  with:
    applicationName: vue-example
    distributionDirectory: dist
    apiKey: ${{ secrets.NOTLIFY_API_KEY }}
```

- **Administrative UI** Notlify ships a Control Plane UI at https://notlify.dev. Login with a GitHub account, connect a public repo, and add the GitHub action to try it out.

- **Serverless GraphQL Admin API** The Notlify UI is backed by an Apollo GraphQL server in a Lambda function, using DynamoDB as a data store.
- **Website Deployments via GitHub Actions** Notlify executes individual website deployments to a separate AWS Account, using a distinct stage in the user's chosen region.
