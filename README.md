### What is Notlify?

This is primarily an example of building a Platform as a Service with AWS technologies.

- **Static Websites** Websites with static assets are all supported. They are continuously deployed on commit to an S3 bucket with a CloudFront distribution.
- **Custom GitHub Action** Notlify applications are simply deployed with a custom GitHub Action

```yaml
- name: Deploy UI
  uses: JakePartusch/notlify-action@main
  with:
    applicationName: vue-example
    distributionDirectory: dist
    apiKey: ${{ secrets.NOTLIFY_API_KEY }}
```

- **Administrative UI** Notlify ships a Control Plane UI at https://notlify.dev.
